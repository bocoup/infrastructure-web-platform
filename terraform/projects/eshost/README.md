# eshost

This Amazon S3 bucket is currently home to a custom build of ChakraCore for Linux. The custom build has all debugging flags enabled, which is necessary for testing [`eshost`](https://github.com/bterlson/eshost).

In the future, [Rick Waldron](mailto:rick@bocoup.com) hopes to have a system in place that creates and stores custom builds of all JavaScript engines' nightlies.
