# eshost

This Amazon S3 bucket is currently home to a custom build of ChakraCore for Linux. The custom build has all debugging flags enabled, which is necessary for testing `eshost`.

In the future, I hope to have a system in place that creates and stores custom builds of all JavaScript engines' nightlies.
